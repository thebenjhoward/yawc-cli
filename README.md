Yet Another Wordle Clone

A simple cli version of wordle with planned support for custom word lists. 

This was made as a short project to brush up on my C memory management. As nice
as memory managed languages are, you never know when you're gonna get thrust into
some low level/embedded stuff where you can't take data structures for granted.
Eventually, the plan is to add custom styles alongside word lists, but who knows
if I'll end up having time for that.
